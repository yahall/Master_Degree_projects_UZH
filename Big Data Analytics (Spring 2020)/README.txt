The ZIP files contains the following files for our group project:

 - Big_Data_Analytics_Group_2_Traffic_accidents_analysis.ipynb

		Python Jupyter notebook containing all our code/analysis.
		Instructions about the required environment are at the
		beginning of the Jupyter notebook. The last parts of the notebook
		require some additional packages which require a bit more work
		to setup (kepler.gl, TensorFlow/Keras). That's why we have
		separately added the result of the kepler.gl geospatial
		visualization as HTML files (map_export_London.html, map_export_Scotland.html)
		and screenshots (map_export_London.png, map_export_Scotland.png).

		Also, we have saved a HTML version of the Jupyter Notebook which
		shows all results apart form the kepler.gl maps, for those see the
		separate HTML files.

		Regarding data, we have structured the Notebook in such a way that it
		directly downloads the raw data files from the respective websites into
		the project root directory folder "uktraffic" (~683 MB). This should work
		without any problems and reasonably fast (<15s with fast internet connection),
		just in case the download doesn't work, we have uploaded the
		folder "uktraffic" here:

			https://www.dropbox.com/s/obikjnuzo3tbv01/uktraffic.zip?dl=0

		You can place the folder "uktraffic" in the same folder as the
		Jupyter notebook, then the download is skipped.
