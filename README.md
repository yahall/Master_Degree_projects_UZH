# Master_Degree_projects_UZH
This repository contains the submitted files and codes of all relevant term papers and group projects I completed during my Master's degree at the University of Zurich. The purpose is to provide insights into my scientific toolkit and, where possible, to provide assistance and inspiration to undergraduate collegues.
